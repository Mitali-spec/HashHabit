###JavaScript Observations and Learnings

While experimenting with JavaScript in the browser console, I observed that let appears to work similarly to var for basic variable declaration and updating.

However, this similarity is mainly visible in simple console usage; in actual programs, let and var differ significantly in terms of scope, redeclaration rules, and safety, with let being block-scoped and more reliable.

I also learned that even though arrays declared using const cannot be reassigned, their elements can still be modified. For example, using arr.push() allows adding new elements to a const array. 

This shows that JavaScript arrays can behave like a stack when using methods such as push() (to add elements) and pop() (to remove elements).

The primitive data types in JavaScript include string, number, boolean, null, and undefined.

While null is a primitive data type that represents an intentional absence of value, checking typeof null returns "object". This is a well-known historical bug in JavaScript that has been retained for backward compatibility. Despite this behavior, null is not an object.

The undefined value indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned any value. 

In contrast, null is explicitly assigned by the developer to indicate an empty or unknown value.
