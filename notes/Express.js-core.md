# Express.js and Node.js – Core Understanding

 Express.js can make my computer act as a server.
 Using Express.js, a login form in the browser can send HTTP requests
 (GET/POST) to the server, which can then connect to a database
 to authenticate users or store data.

 Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.
 Because of Node.js, JavaScript can:
 - Create servers
 - Listen on network ports
 - Handle HTTP requests and responses
 - Access the file system
 - Communicate with databases

# Relationship:

 Node.js  -> provides the runtime and system-level capabilities
 
 Express  -> simplifies building HTTP servers on top of Node.js
